# Eat-Da-Buger App Overview
This application uses a database to log types of burgers the user wishes to try. The user can enter the name of the burger they want to try (or have tried in the past but want to eat again). Burgers on the left side are ones waiting to be eaten. Once the user selects Devour it, the burger will move to the right side. If the user does not like the burger or no longer wants to try it, the user can select the Yuck, delete button.
